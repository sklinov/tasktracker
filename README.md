# tasktracker
Simple pure PHP, JQuery and Bootstrap application for adding and editing tasks.
If you want to use it, you need to add `config.php` in the `/config` folder containing credentials to connect to your MySQL or MariaDB database:
```
$host = "";
$db_name = "";
$username = "";
$password = "";
```
